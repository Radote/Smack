Smack automatically blocks unproductive websites - no need to set-up a whitelist/blacklist that is outsmarted, or too big/small! Smack also adapts
to your current needs dynamically.

## Getting started

Smack is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

First, get an [Anthropic account](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard) and load some cash on it (5 bucks will get you going for a couple of months). Then, get an API-key.

##### Release (recommended)

NOTE: Currently, only Linux works. This will be fixed ASAP!

Under the release tab (to the right), click on it. Then download the .zip file corresponding to your OS, unzip, and voil√†, there's the executable! Drag-and-drop to your favourite location and double-click when ready. Make sure to fill out all the necessary things under the settings page (e.g. API-key) and you're good to go!

##### Source

The entry-point is smack.py, so if you run that (with necessary dependencies) you're good to go. If you want to build from source, install dependencies and then run

```
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "smack.qml:." --add-data "images/\*:images" smack.py
```

## FAQ

#### How much do the API calls cost?

I've barely gone upwards of 5 cents a day. With time, it will also get more efficient as it gets to know your most frequent (productive and unproductive) websites.

#### It doesn't seem to work for some browsers (Linux)

Yeah, unfortunately Wayland seems to interfere with the functioning of the program. It does work for Brave. If somebody knows any good tab-reading libraries/utilities for Linux, let me know! (Currently, we use xdotool).

#### Where is all my data stored?

All data is stored in the respective config directory of an OS. Note your API-key is stored in plaintext.

#### It misclassified something

First, kill Smack.

1. Give a better task prompt when it queries you at startup.
2. Change your self-description (under the settings page) so that it better matches you.
3. If it's a specific website (e.g. WhatsApp), add it in Settings under either "Allow website" or "Block website".

A very advanced use-case (if you have the money), is to store these misclassified examples, and later finetune your own model on e.g. Anthropic. I really couldn't imagine that's necessary though. I have very specific requirements and still do great with the current setup.

#### How do you recommend using this?

I'd let it calibrate to you for a day. I set the program to turn on at startup. Afterwards, for the sake of habit, don't mess with it!

Most will probably want to use this for work. But even when you're just chilling on the internet I think it's helpful - for example, you could ask it to stop you from doomscrolling.

#### Why not just use Freedom/ColdTurkey etc.?

I love ColdTurkey! Sadly, I use Linux. Moreover, generic blacklists didn't quite work for me - I loved reading _anything_, so blocking youtube.com made me end up on Wikipedia, blocking Wikipedia on Our World in Data, etc. etc. Moreover, I may want to access Wikipedia pages related to programming, but not the Wikipedia controversies section of [insert favourite celebrity here].

No more of that! Smack is extremely intelligent by default.

#### What if I want to just have fun on weekends?

Next time you run the program, say so in the prompt!

#### What are good model providers?

OpenAI, Anthropic and Google's LLM's performed well. Unfortunately, Mistral's LLM did not yet have broad enough knowledge for this task.

I'd recommend choosing based on:

1. Price
2. Whether you can pay (OpenAI requires credit cards, for example)

#### What about privacy?

Excellent point. This really depends on what you're comfortable with. The people working on Smack obviously get none of your data. That said, it does query a model in the background, so the organization will get that information. Many of the big model providers have a 30-day retention policy (for API calls), but afterwards get rid of it.
